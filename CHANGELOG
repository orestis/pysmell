PySmell v0.7.1 - 4 Nov 2008

More robust TextMate support, better error reporting on Vim.

PySmell v0.7 - 2 Nov 2008

Added module member completion: "import os" followed by "os." will give members of os.
Added rudimentary type-inferencing: 
	a = A() # A is a class.
	"a" will be detected as an instance of A.
A lot of under-the-hood refactoring, making adding features easier.
Added setuptools support: pysmell is now a script. Thanks, Michael Thalmeier
Added Emacs support. Thanks, Tom Wright
Added TextMate support. Thanks, dbr - http://neverfear.org/
PySmell has now a bug tracker on Google Code. Also available at PyPI.


PySmell v0.6 - 13 Oct 2008

Added module completion, including absolute and relative imports. Completing import
statements works, but the messages may look a bit wonky - please report oddities.

Added support for 'static' libraries - Basically, PYSMELLTAGS.* will now be
used, but you still have to have a root PYSMELLTAGS file. Look at README for
more information.

Improved handling of single files and package detection
Python 2.4-2.5 can now be analyzed with no errors.
Renamed pysmelltags.py to pysmell.py
Added shebang to pysmell.py


PySmell v0.5 - 15 Sep 2008

Bug fix: infinite loop when no PYSMELLTAGS is found.


PySmell v0.4 - 11 Sep 2008

Improved class detection: Now works even for classes which are not present in PYSMELLDICT
Improved import handling: "absolute" imports work, as well as imported name detection.
This version sort-of correctly handles Django (not the dynamic part of course!)


PySmell v0.3 - 10 Sep 2008

Added simple type-inferencing when inside classes, hardcoded to "self". It will present methods and properties
of current and parent classes (but not built-in types). It only works with relative imports for now.
When you auto-complete right after a function/method call's opening parenthesis, the arguments will be filled in.
You can select out of seven matching behaviours - look in pysmell.vim for possible options.
Big improvements on correctness of PYSMELLTAGS files.

Bugfix: Set Vim to display duplicate arguments
Bugfix: change name of omnifunc so to not clash with built-in python omnicompletion


PySmell v0.2 - 1 Sep 2008

Added support for nested packages
Exceptions in files are not blocking the process
Switched to parseFile, shouldn't have to worry about line endings


PySmell v0.1 - 31 Aug 2008

Initial, roughly working version
